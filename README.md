Fit Log is a web application created in order to help people
achieve their fitness goals. It's main functionality is keeping
track of what exercises each user does on each respective
workout days.

On first access of the page, the user is presented with a login
page. Here he can choose to register if he doesn't possess an
account, or login to his registered account.

Once logged in, in the navigation bar up top are presented 5
options: Workouts, Exercises, Timer, About You and Log Out.

In the Workouts page, the user can view the exercises in today's
workout. He can add exercises to the workout and go to different
dates to appoint new exercises for the future, or see the
exercises executed in the past.

In the Exercises page, the user can learn about exercises that
are currently in the database, or he can create a new exercise
via the create exercise form.

In the Timer page, as the name suggests, the user can set a timer
for himself, a function very useful during training. When time
is finished a whistle is blown to alert the user.

In the About You page, details about the currently logged in
user are presented. Also here the user can change his account
password and username.

When pressing Log Out the user is logged out of his account and
redirected back to the Log In page.
